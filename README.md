A proof-of-concept bot to automate petition signups for petitions on the official governemt petitons website (https://petition.parliament.uk).

For sign ups to be registered, they must be validated through a verification link sent via Email. While this is trivial to automate, I'll refrain from distributing that code to help prevent site abuse.
